# Permuting-Two-Arrays-Hacker-Rank
There are two n-element arrays of integers, A and B. Permute them into some A'  and B' such that the relation $A'[i] + B'[i] \geq k$ holds for all $i$ where $0 \leq i < n$.

There will be q queries consisting of A,B, and k . For each query, return YES if some permutation A',B' ,  satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.
